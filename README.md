## Assignments
- Assignment 1: Edge Detection (Score: 9/10)
- Assignment 2: Image preprocessing, RANSAC, and Hough Transform (Score 9.5/10)
- Assignment 3: Feature Detection and Image Alignment (Score: 4.8/10; I got sick during the week)
- Assignment 4: Image Segmentation and Pixel Classification (Score: 12/10; solved the bonus question)

## Optional End of Projects
Apart from the Assignments and Midterm exam, some optional projects were also given to boost the score. Since I did poorly in Assignment 3, I decided to finish it. The problems related to Image Data Association, Image Segmentation and Simple Non Iterative Clustering (SNIC). Got 5 points for all the projects.

**Final Grade:** A (99.72%)
